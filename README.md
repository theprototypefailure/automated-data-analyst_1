flags, a forecast, and answers to plain-English questions — with the calculation
shown under every number.**

## What it does

ADA reads your file, works out which column is the metric, which is the date,
and which is the segment, then builds the analysis around that.

- **Dashboard** — trend, segment breakdown, movement waterfall, segment × period heatmap
- **Ask ADA** — plain-English questions answered locally with pandas, calculation shown
- **Anomaly flags** — periods outside a calibrated band, sized so a stable series false-alarms about once in twenty analyses
- **Forecast** — a guarded baseline that refuses to run on thin history and reports when it was no better than assuming no change
- **Evidence and next steps** — every finding carries its calculation; recommendations are labelled as interpretation, never as cause
- **Downloads** — Markdown executive brief and cleaned CSV

Limits: 25 MB per file, 250,000 rows analyzed. Formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`.

### Nothing to upload? Try a sample

Pick **Try a sample dataset** in the app, or download one from [`samples/`](https://github.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/tree/main/samples):

| Sample | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [SaaS subscriptions](https://github.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/blob/main/samples/saas-subscriptions.csv) | A real revenue drop the anomaly radar finds, and a forecast that beats no-change |
| [Support tickets](https://github.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/blob/main/samples/support-tickets.csv) | No revenue column, and a forecast honest enough to say it is useless |
| [Ecommerce orders](https://github.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/blob/main/samples/ecommerce-orders.csv) | Returns as negative rows, so totals cope with mixed signs |

All three are synthetic, so they carry no privacy or licensing baggage.

### Ask a business question. Get the number and its calculation.

![Ask ADA a plain-English question and receive a pandas-backed answer with its calculation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/main/assets/readme/ask-ada.gif)

### Focus on one segment. The whole analysis regroups.

![Drill into one business segment and automatically regroup the dashboard by the next useful dimension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/main/assets/readme/drilldown.gif)

## Run it

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server (binds to port 3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

No API key required. The app opens directly with a built-in deterministic demo dataset, pre-loaded sample datasets (SaaS Subscriptions, Support Tickets, Ecommerce Orders), and drag-and-drop CSV/Excel file loading.

## Architecture

This application was migrated to modern **React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** with client-side deterministic data processing:

- **Data Ingestion**: PapaParse (CSV) and SheetJS/XLSX (Excel) running client-side with zero remote data transfer.
- **Schema Engine**: Deterministic column role scoring (Measure, Date, Dimension, Identifier, adverse measure detection).
- **Analytics Engine**: Theil-Sen robust trendline fitting, critical multiplier-calibrated anomaly detection, guarded forecasting, and Pareto concentration analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive Recharts components (Trend & Guarded Forecast, Segment Breakdown with drill-down, Movement Waterfall, and Segment × Period Matrix Heatmap).
- **Ask ADA (NLQ)**: Deterministic natural language query engine showing arithmetic calculation formulas underneath every answer.
- **Data Audit & Export**: Full dataset schema summary, raw table preview, cleaned CSV download, and Markdown Executive Brief export.

## Does my data leave my machine?

**Running ADA yourself: no.** Cleaning, schema detection, every chart, and every
Ask ADA answer are computed locally with pandas, with no network call at all.

**Using the hosted demo: your file is uploaded to a Streamlit server**, because
that is what uploading a file to a website means. It is held in memory for the
session and never written to a database. If that matters for your data, run ADA
locally — it is four commands above and needs no key.

An optional AI layer adds two things when you supply a key: a query planner for
questions the rules cannot parse, and a strategic narrative. The planner shows
its proposed calculation and waits for your confirmation before ADA executes it
locally. **Neither ever receives your rows.** They receive column names, types,
and already-computed evidence — and because an evidence sentence names the
segment it is about, a segment label such as a customer or product name can
appear in it. Nothing else from a cell does. Model-generated code is never
executed.

## Contributing

Good places to start: a new question shape for Ask ADA, a new deterministic
metric, schema-detection fixtures, chart accessibility, adversarial test data.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), browse the
[good first issues](https://github.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/labels/good%20first%20issue),
or pick something from the [roadmap](https://github.com/saineshnakra/automated-data-analyst/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

Every new recommendation needs a test and the calculation that supports it.

## Building on ADA?
